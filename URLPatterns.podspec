                        URLPatterns is a small library to enable more idiomatic Swift pattern matching of URL path elements.
                    `NSURL` is extended with the method `countedPathElements()`, which converts the URL's' array of path elements
                    into a `Counted` enum. Each case in `Counted` has a different number of associated values, which makes
                    pattern-matching each element easy, including wildcard, value-binding, begins and ends patterns.
